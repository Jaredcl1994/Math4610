This is the data from derivative1 without the taylor expansion:


0 0.841471 
1 0.958851 
2 0.989616 
3 0.997398 
4 0.999349 
5 0.999837 
6 0.999959 
7 0.99999 
8 0.999997 
9 0.999999 
10 1

12 1 

This is the data from derivative1 using taylor expansion after the first 3 cycles.

The code using taylor expansion departed from the expected value more quickly than the one not using it.
